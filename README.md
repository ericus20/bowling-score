## Bowling Score Calculator
Create a program, which, given a valid sequence of throws for one game of American Ten-Pin
Bowling, produces the total score for the game . Your code will become the core of a bowling score
management system, so make sure it fully complies with the input and output requirements, and
represents your best code.
